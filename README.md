`cadence-flow` is a Python library that translates an AI agent's plan into an interactive web UI for human oversight and action. Instead of printing "Waiting for approval..." to a terminal, you can now spin up a rich, interactive session for any human-in-the-loop task with a single line of code: `cadence_flow.run()`.

It's designed for developers building complex AI agents, chains, or RAG systems that require critical human checkpoints for tasks like:
*   Approving a high-stakes action (e.g., sending an email, running code).
*   Validating data or model outputs.
*   Selecting from multiple choices generated by an LLM.

## ✨ The "Wow Moment"

Define a plan in Python, and let Cadence Flow orchestrate it in an interactive UI.

## How It Works

Cadence acts as a lightweight orchestrator that runs your agent's logic, communicates with a web UI, and pauses to wait for your input.

Your code defines a `TaskPlan` (a list of steps) and an `executor_func` (the logic to run for each step). `cadence-flow` takes care of the rest: starting a web server, serving the UI, and managing the state.

The core interaction flow looks like this:

This simple pattern allows Cadence to supervise any Python-based agent. For specific examples with popular frameworks, see our **[Integration Guides for LangChain, CrewAI, and more](./docs/integrations.md)**.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

`cadence-flow` requires Python 3.9+.

```bash
pip install cadence-flow
```
<!-- In README.md, inside the "Getting Started" section -->

### 2. Your First Workflow

Create a file named `my_first_flow.py` and paste the following code.

```python
import time
import uuid
import cadence_flow as cf  # <-- CONVENTION APPLIED
from cadence_flow.models import TaskPlan, Step

# 1. Define the plan
def create_greeting_plan(name: str) -> TaskPlan:
    return TaskPlan(
        plan_id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
        title=f"Greeting Plan for {name}",
        steps=[
            Step(id="s1_generate", description="Agent generates a creative greeting."),
            Step(id="s2_approve", description="Human approves the greeting.", ui_component="human_approval"),
            Step(id="s3_send", description="Send the approved greeting."),
        ]
    )

# 2. Define the executor for automated steps
def execute_step(step: Step, plan: TaskPlan) -> Step:
    # ... (executor logic as before)
    return step

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_plan = create_greeting_plan("Alice")
    
    # 3. Run it!
    final_plan = cf.run(plan=my_plan, executor_func=execute_step)  # <-- CONVENTION APPLIED
    
    print("\n--- Workflow Finished ---")
    print(final_plan.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```

### 3. Run the flow

Execute the script from your terminal: `python my_first_flow.py`

A web browser will automatically open with your interactive workflow UI!

## 🗺️ Roadmap

`cadence-flow` is in its early stages. Our vision is to build a comprehensive ecosystem for human-in-the-loop AI.
